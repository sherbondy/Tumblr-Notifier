Tumblr Notifier
================

This is an Extension for Safari 5.
If you want to see its guts, check out global.html.
latest_post.js is an injected script that simply extracts the ID of the most recent post in your Tumblr Dashboard when you visit the site. The rest of the time, Notifier just queues Tumblr's [Dashboard API](http://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/api#api_dashboard).

Email addresses and passwords are stored as secure settings.

If you're interested in modifying the extension, I suggest you sign up for the [Safari Developer Program](http://developer.apple.com/safari/) and get a Signing Certificate.
