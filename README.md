Tumblr Notifier
================

This is a browser Extension for Safari and Google Chrome.
If you want to see its guts, check out global.html in either folder.
latest_post.js/contentscript.js is an injected script that simply extracts the URL that Tumblr's abacus uses to check for new posts.

If you're interested in modifying the extension, I suggest you sign up for the [Safari Developer Program](http://developer.apple.com/safari/) and get a Signing Certificate.
